This project has been put on hold for the time being due to other priorities.

This is an implementation of some basic machine learning algorithms, written from scratch in lua.
The primary purpose of this project was to teach myself about the fundamentals of machine learning, and gain some experience.

Currently it implements a basic form of machine learning, but is highly innefficient.
My goal is to implement back propagation, and turn this into a more useable machine learning library.
